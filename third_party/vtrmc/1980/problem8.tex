Let $z = x + iy$ be a complex number with $x$ and $y$ rational and with
$|z| = 1$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Find two such complex numbers.

\item Show that $\left| z^{2n} - 1 \right| = 2 \left| \sin n \theta \right|$,
      where $z = e^{i \theta}$.

\item Show that $\left| z^{2n} - 1 \right|$ is rational for every $n$.

\end{enumerate}
