Let $f(x)$ be an arbitrary differentiable function on $I = [x_0 - h, x_0 + h]$
with $|f'(x)| <= M$ on $I$ where $M >= sqrt(3)$. Let $f(x_0 - h) <= f(x_0)$
and $f(x_0+h) <= f(x_0)$. Find the smallest positive number $r$ such that at
least one local maximum of $f$ lies inside or on the circle of radius $r$
centered at $(x_0, f(x_0))$. Express your answer in terms of $h$, $M$ and
$d = min { f(x_0) - f(x_0 - h), f(x_0) - f(x_0 + h) }$.
