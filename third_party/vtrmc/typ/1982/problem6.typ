Let $S$ be a set of positive integers and let $E$ be the operation on the set
of subsets of $S$ defined by $E A = { x in A mid(|) x "is even" }$, where
$A subset.eq S$. Let $C A$ denote the complement of $A$ in $S$. $E C E A$ will
denote $E(C(E A))$, etc.

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ Show that $E C E C E A = E A$.
+ Find the maximum number of distinct subsets of $S$ that can be generated by
   applying the operations $E$ and $C$ to a subset $A$ of $S$ an arbitrary number
   of times in any order.
