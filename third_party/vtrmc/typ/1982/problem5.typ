When asked to state the Maclaurin Series, a student writes (incorrectly)

$ (*) quad f(x) = f(x) + x f'(x) + x^2 / (2!) f''(x) + x^3 / (3!) f'''(x) + ... $

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ State Maclaurin's Series for $f(x)$ correctly.
+ Replace the left-hand side of $(*)$ by a simple closed form expression in
   $f$ in such a way that the statement becomes valid (in general).
