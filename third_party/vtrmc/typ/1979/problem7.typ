Let $S$ be a finite set of non-negative integers such that $| x - y| in S$
for all $x, y in S$.

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")
+ Give an example of such a set which contains ten elements.
+ If $A$ is a subset of $S$ containing more than two-thirds of the elements of $S$, prove or disprove that every element of $S$ is the sum or difference of two elements from $A$.
