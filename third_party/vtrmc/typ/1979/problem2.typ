#let circ = $circle.stroked.tiny$

Let $S$ be a set which is closed under the binary operation $circ$, with the
following properties:

#set enum(numbering: "(i)")
+ there is an element $e in S$ such that $a circ e = e circ a = a$, for each $a in S$,
+ $(a circ b) circ (c circ d) = (a circ c) circ (b circ d)$, for all $a, b, c, d in S$.

Prove or disprove:

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")
+ $circ$ is associative on $S$
+ $circ$ is commutative on $S$
