Consider an infinite sequence ${ c_k }_(k=0)^oo$ of circles. The largest,
$C_0$, is centered at $(1, 1)$ and is tangent to both the $x$ and $y$-axes.
Each smaller circle $C_n$ is centered on the line through $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$
and is tangent to the next larger circle $C_(n-1)$ and to the $x$-axis. Denote
the diameter of $C_n$ by $d_n$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.

Find:

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ $d_1$
+ $sum_(n=0)^oo d_n$
