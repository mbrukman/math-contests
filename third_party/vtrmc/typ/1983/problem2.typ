A positive integer $N$ (in base $10$) is called _special_ if the operation
$C$ of replacing each digit $d$ of $N$ by its nine's-complement $9 - d$,
followed by the operation $R$ of reversing the order of the digits, results in
the original number. (For example, $3456$ is a special number because
$R[(C 3456)] = 3456$.) Find the sum of all special positive integers less than
one million which do not end in zero or nine.
