Let $f(x) = 1/x$ and $g(x) = 1 - x$ for $x in (0, 1)$. List all distinct
functions that can be written in the form $f compose g compose f compose g compose
... compose f compose g compose f$ where $compose$ represents composition. Write
each function in the form $(a x + b)/(c x + d)$ and prove that your list is
exhaustive.
