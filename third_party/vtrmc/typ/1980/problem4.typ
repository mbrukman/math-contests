Let $P(x)$ be any polynomial of degree at most $3$. It can be shown that there
are numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $integral_(-1)^1 P(x) dif x =
P(x_1) + P(x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are independent of the polynomial $P$.

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ Show that $x_1 = - x_2$.
+ Find $x_1$ and $x_2$.
