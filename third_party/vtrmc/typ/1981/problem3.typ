Let $A$ be non-zero square matrix with the property that $A^3 = 0$, where $0$
is the zero matrix, but with $A$ being otherwise arbitrary.

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ Express $(I - A)^(-1)$ as a polynomial in $A$, where $I$ is the identity
  matrix.
+ Find a $3 times 3$ matrix satisfying $B^2 != 0$, $B^3 = 0$.

\end{enumerate}
