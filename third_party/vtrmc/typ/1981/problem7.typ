Let $A = {a_0, a_1, ...}$ be a sequence of real numbers and define the sequence
$A' = {a_0', a_1', ...}$ as follows for $n = 0, 1, ...$: $a_(2n)' = a_n$,
$a_(2n + 1)' = a_n + 1$. If $a_0 = 1$ and $A' = A$, find

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $a_4$
+ $a_1981$
+ A simple general algorithm for evaluating $a_n$, for $n = 0, 1, ...$
