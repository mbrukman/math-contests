A matrix is called excellent if it is square and the sum of its elements in
each row and column equals the sum of its elements in every other row and
column. Let $V_n$ denote the collection of excellent $n \times n$ matrices.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Show that $V_n$ is a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication (by real numbers).
\item Find the dimensions of $V_2$, $V_3$, and $V_4$.
\item If $A \in V_n$ and $B \in V_n$, show that $AB \in V_n$.

\end{enumerate}
