Let $S$ be a set which is closed under the binary operation $\circ$, with the
following properties:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item there is an element $e \in S$ such that $a \circ e = e \circ a = a$, for
each $a \in S$,
\item $(a \circ b) \circ (c \circ d) = (a \circ c) \circ (b \circ d)$, for all
$a, b, c, d \in S$.
\end{enumerate}

Prove or disprove:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\circ$ is associative on $S$
\item $\circ$ is commutative on $S$
\end{enumerate}
