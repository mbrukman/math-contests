Consider an infinite sequence $\lbrace c_k \rbrace_{k=0}^\infty$ of circles.
The largest, $C_0$, is centered at $(1, 1)$ and is tangent to both the $x$ and
$y$-axes. Each smaller circle $C_n$ is centered on the line through $(1, 1)$
and $(2, 0)$ and is tangent to the next larger circle $C_{n−1}$ and to the
$x$-axis. Denote the diameter of $C_n$ by $d_n$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$.

Find:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item $d_1$
\item $\displaystyle{ \sum_{n=0}^\infty d_n }$

\end{enumerate}
