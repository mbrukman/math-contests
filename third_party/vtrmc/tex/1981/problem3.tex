Let $A$ be non-zero square matrix with the property that $A^3 = 0$, where $0$
is the zero matrix, but with $A$ being otherwise arbitrary.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Express $(I - A)^{-1}$ as a polynomial in $A$, where $I$ is the identity
      matrix.
\item Find a $3 \times 3$ matrix satisfying $B^2 \ne 0$, $B^3 = 0$.

\end{enumerate}
