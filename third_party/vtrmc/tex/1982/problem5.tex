When asked to state the Maclaurin Series, a student writes (incorrectly)

$$ (*) \quad f(x) = f(x) + x f'(x) + \frac{x^2}{2!} f''(x) + \frac{x^3}{3!} f'''(x) + ... $$

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item State Maclaurin's Series for $f(x)$ correctly.
\item Replace the left-hand side of $(*)$ by a simple closed form expression in
   $f$ in such a way that the statement becomes valid (in general).

\end{enumerate}
