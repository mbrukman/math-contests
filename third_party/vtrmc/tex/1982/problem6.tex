Let $S$ be a set of positive integers and let $E$ be the operation on the set
of subsets of $S$ defined by $EA = \{ x \in A \mid x \text{ is even} \}$, where
$A \subseteq S$. Let $CA$ denote the complement of $A$ in $S$. $ECEA$ will
denote $E(C(EA))$, etc.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Show that $ECECEA = EA$.
\item Find the maximum number of distinct subsets of $S$ that can be generated by
   applying the operations $E$ and $C$ to a subset $A$ of $S$ an arbitrary number
   of times in any order.

\end{enumerate}
