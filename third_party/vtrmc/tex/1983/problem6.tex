Let $f(x) = 1/x$ and $g(x) = 1 - x$ for $x \in (0, 1)$. List all distinct
functions that can be written in the form $f \circ g \circ f \circ g \circ
\cdots \circ f \circ g \circ f$ where $\circ$ represents composition. Write
each function in the form $\dfrac{ax + b}{cx + d}$ and prove that your list is
exhaustive.
