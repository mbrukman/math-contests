A finite set of roads connect $n$ towns $T_1, T_2, ..., T_n$ where $n \ge 2$.
We say that towns $T_i$ and $T_j$ $(i \ne j)$ are directly connected if there
is a road segment connecting $T_i$ and $T_j$ which does not pass through any
other town. Let $f(T_k)$ be the number of other towns directly connected to
$T_k$. Prove that $f$ is not one-to-one.
